4. Add `/doc` and comments to other API endpoint functions in the backend

**Notice**: When adding comments, ensure GitHub Copilot Chat applies custom instructions with each request.

### 1.6 Generate Unit Tests

**Instructions:**
1. Open `frontend/src/util/calculator.js` - the file contains simple calculator util functions
2. Open `frontend/src/util/calculator.test.js` (this file should exist but be empty)
3. Select all the code in `calculator.js` and press `Cmd+I` (macOS) or `Ctrl+I` (Windows)
4. Type `/tests` - GitHub Copilot will generate unit tests for the selected functions
5. If they weren't created by Copilot in `calculator.test.js`, copy the generated tests into `calculator.test.js`
6. From the `frontend` directory, run tests: `npm test src/util/calculator.test.js`
7. If tests fail, copy the terminal error message, select the failing test code, press `Ctrl+I`/`Cmd+I`, and type `/fix` followed by pasting the error message

**Alternative approach using Chat:**
- Open GitHub Copilot Chat
- Attach the `frontend/src/util/calculator.js` file to the chat
- Ask: "Generate Jest unit tests for all functions in this calculator file"
- Copy the generated tests to `frontend/src/util/calculator.test.js`

### 1.7 Fix Your Code with GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot assists in fixing code errors by analyzing context to suggest corrections.

**Instructions:**
1. Navigate to the errors page at http://localhost:3000/errors (this is an 'Add NBA player' page)
2. Fill in the form and click 'Create player' button
3. You should see a 404 error - the API endpoint was not found!
4. Ask Copilot to `/explain` the error with context of `frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/errors/page.tsx`
5. The frontend sends a POST request to `/api/players` - but does this route exist in the backend?
6. Open `backend/app.py` and search for the player creation endpoint
7. **Find the bug**: Compare the route name in the backend with what the frontend is calling. There's a mismatch!
8. Fix the route name in `backend/app.py` to match the frontend request
9. Restart the backend server and test the form again
10. You should now see "Player created successfully!" message
11. Ask Copilot to rename the page from "errors" to something more descriptive like "add-player"

**Note**: This exercise demonstrates debugging API communication issues between frontend and backend. 

### 1.8 Create Player Info Feature

Create a comprehensive player information display using file attachments.

**Instructions:**
1. Add these files to Chat context (attach files or drag&drop):
   - `backend/app.py` - Look at the `get_player_info` function to understand the API
   - `backend/data/player-info.json` - Players data

2. Ask Copilot using either edit or agent mode: 
   ```
   Create a new Next.js page at /players-info that fetches player data from the backend API endpoint /api/player-info (running on http://localhost:8080). The page should display a list of player information showing only the id, name, team, weight, height, and position properties. Ensure each player is displayed in a separate card. Use TailwindCSS and shadcn components to style the output. The page should handle loading states and errors appropriately.
   ```

3. Create the page in `frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/players-info/page.tsx`
4. The page should fetch from `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8080'}/api/player-info`
5. Open http://localhost:3000/players-info and verify results

**Note**: This demonstrates how the frontend communicates with the backend API to fetch and display data.


### 1.9 Optimize Code With GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot Chat can help you optimize code (refactor behavior without changing functionality).

**Instructions:**
1. Start both services:
   - Terminal 1: `cd backend && python app.py` (backend on port 8080)
   - Terminal 2: `cd frontend && npm run dev` (frontend on port 3000)
2. Click on 'Optimization' page in the web app left menu 
3. Wait until the page finishes loading - the page is intentionally slow for demonstration purposes
4. Find the backend API route that serves the optimization data:
   - Open `backend/app.py` and locate the `/api/optimize` endpoint (around line 198)
5. **Choose chat model Claude Sonnet 4.5** for best optimization results
6. Ask Copilot Chat: "Optimize this code to improve performance" while having the `optimize` function in context
7. The function has an intentionally large prompt string that could be optimized
8. Make the suggested optimizations in `backend/app.py`
9. Restart the backend server and reload the page to verify it loads faster

**Note**: This demonstrates optimizing backend API performance. The execution time is shown on the page for comparison.

## Task 7 - GitHub Copilot CLI

GitHub Copilot CLI is a powerful terminal-based AI assistant that brings the full capabilities of GitHub Copilot directly to your command line. Unlike traditional CLI tools, Copilot CLI works as an interactive agent that can understand your codebase, make changes, and help you build features through natural language conversations.

### 7.1 Installation and Setup

**Step 1: Install Copilot CLI**

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Install using npm (recommended)
npm install -g @githubnext/github-copilot-cli
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Install using npm
npm install -g @githubnext/github-copilot-cli
```

**Step 2: Verify Installation**
```bash
copilot --version
```

**Step 3: Open your workspace**

Navigate to the folder containing your code and launch Copilot CLI:
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
copilot
```

The first time you run it, you'll be prompted to authenticate with GitHub. Follow the authentication flow in your browser.

### 7.2 Using GitHub Copilot CLI

Once authenticated, Copilot CLI runs as an interactive agent in your terminal.

**Launch Copilot CLI:**
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd ../../GitHub_Copilot_Workshop

# Launch Copilot CLI
copilot
```

**Switch Models (Optional):**

Once Copilot CLI is running, you can switch models using the `/model` slash command:
```
/model
```

Usefull command:
```
/share → Share session to markdown file or GitHub gist
/mcp → Manage MCP server configurations
/usage → Display session usage metrics and statistics
```

**Basic Usage:**

After launching Copilot CLI, simply describe what you want to accomplish in natural language. Copilot will:
- Understand your codebase context
- Generate or modify code files
- Execute commands when appropriate
- Explain its reasoning and approach

### 7.3 Hands-On Exercise: Enhance the NBA Workshop App

#### **Exercise 1: Add a Teams Feature**

1. **Launch Copilot CLI in the workshop directory:**

2. **Give Copilot a prompt to add a complete Teams feature:**
   ```
   Create a new Teams API route and display it on the web interface. 
   The API should return a list of NBA teams with their name, city, and conference.
   Add a new page at /teams that displays this data in cards using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components.
   Also add a navigation link to the teams page.
   ```

3. **Review Copilot's plan:**
   - Copilot will analyze your codebase structure
   - It will show you which files it plans to create or modify
   - Review the proposed changes before accepting

4. **Accept or refine the changes:**
   - If you're happy with the plan, confirm to proceed
   - If you want adjustments, provide additional instructions
   - Copilot will iterate based on your feedback

#### **Exercise 2: Add Search Functionality**

Continue your Copilot CLI session and add a search feature:

```
Add a search bar to the Teams page that allows users to filter teams by name or city.
The search should work in real-time as the user types.
```

#### **Exercise 3: Create Player Statistics Page**

Ask Copilot to build a more complex feature:

```
Create a new page at /player-stats that shows player statistics.
Create an API route that returns sample data for top 10 NBA players with their points, rebounds, and assists.
Display the data in a sortable table.
Add this page to the navigation menu.
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

### Backend Issues
- **Port 8080 already in use**: Change the port in `backend/app.py` or kill the process using `lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9`
- **Python dependencies not found**: Ensure virtual environment is activated: `source venv/bin/activate` (macOS/Linux) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
- **CORS errors**: Verify the backend is running and CORS origins in `backend/app.py` match your frontend URL

### Frontend Issues
- **Copilot not responding**: Check your authentication and license status
- **API connection errors**: 
  - Verify backend is running on port 8080
  - Check `.env.local` has `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080`
  - Test backend directly: `curl http://localhost:8080/api/health`
- **Build errors**: Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- **Port 3000 conflicts**: Try using a different port with `npm run dev -- -p 3001`

### Network Issues
- **Google Fonts errors during build**: This is expected in restricted networks. The app will still work in development mode with `npm run dev`
- **External API failures**: Some workshop features may require internet access

**Getting Help:**
- Use GitHub Copilot Chat to debug issues
- Check the console for error messages
- Refer to task-specific troubleshooting in each section
- Review `backend/README.md` for backend-specific help
